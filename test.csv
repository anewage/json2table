Scimitar- and dirk-toothed sabertooths are distinct ecomorphs that differ in canine tooth length, degree of serration, and postcranial features indicative of dissimilar predatory behavior [6-13].  Despite these differences, it is assumed that they used a similar ‘canine-shear’ bite to kill their prey [14,15]. We investigated the killing behavior of the scimitar-toothed Homotherium serum and the dirk-toothed Smilodon fatalis using a comparative sample of living carnivores and a new quantitative approach to the analysis of skull function. For the first time, we quantified differences in the relative amount and distribution of cortical and trabecular bone in coronal sections of skulls to assess relative skull stiffness and flexibility [16-19]. We also use finite element analysis to simulate various killing scenarios that load skulls in ways that likely favor distinct proportions of cortical versus trabecular bone across the skull. Our data reveal that S. fatalis had an extremely thick skull and relatively little trabecular bone, consistent with a large investment in cranial strength for a stabbing canine-shear-bite. However, H. serum had more trabecular bone, and likely deployed an unusual predatory behavior more similar to the clamp-and-hold technique of the lion than S. fatalis. These data broaden the killing repertoire of sabertooths and highlight the degree of ecological specialization among members of the large carnivore guild during the Late Pleistocene of North America.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Crocuta_bite</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div

The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4–11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5–7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7,12] to resolve relationships among stinging wasp families, gathering sequence data from > 800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon data set using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Raw sequence reads.</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw Illumina reads for all newly sequenced samples from this study.</div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Alignment supermatrices.</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">All alignment supermatrices from this study.

In prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), variants at the Avpr1a locus predict expression of the vasopressin 1a receptor in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region that mediates spatial and contextual memory; cortical V1aR abundance in turn predicts diversity in space-use and sexual fidelity in the field. To examine the potential contributions of adaptive and neutral forces to variation at the Avpr1a locus, we explore sequence diversity at the Avpr1a locus and throughout the genome in two populations of wild prairie voles. First, we refine results demonstrating balancing selection at the locus by comparing the frequency spectrum of variants at the locus to a random sample of the genome. Next, we find that the four SNPs that predict high V1aR expression in the RSC are in stronger linkage disequilibrium than expected by chance despite high recombination among intervening variants, suggesting that epistatic selection maintains their association despite recombination. Analysis of population structure and a haplotype network for two populations revealed that this excessive LD was unlikely to be due to admixture alone. Furthermore, the two populations differed considerably in the region shown to be a regulator of V1aR expression despite the extremely low levels of genome-wide genetic differentiation. Together, our data suggest that complex selection on Avpr1a locus favors specific combinations of regulatory polymorphisms, maintains the resulting alleles at populations-specific frequencies, and may contribute to unique patterns of spatial cognition and sexual fidelity among populations.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Data and scripts to plot and analyse complex selection in two populations of prairie voles</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This repository contains the data necessary to plot each figure from 1 to 4, and S1 and S2.

Here, we ask how ultimate, evolutionary causes affect dispersal. Building on Hamilton and May's 1977 classic paper (``Dispersal in stable habitats""), we develop analytic and simulation models for the evolution of dispersal kernels in spatially structured habitats. First, we investigate dispersal in a world without edges and find that most offspring disperse as far as possible, opposite the pattern of empirical data. Adding edges to our model world leads to nearly all offspring dispersing short distances, again a mismatch with empirical data. Adding resource heterogeneity improves our results: most offspring disperse short distances with some dispersing longer distances. Finally, we simulate dispersal evolution in a real seascape in Belize and find that the simulated dispersal kernel and an empirical dispersal kernel from that seascape both have the same shape, with a high level of short-distance dispersal and a low level of long-distance dispersal. The novel contribution of this work is to provide a spatially explicit analytic extension of Hamilton and May 1977, to demonstrate that our spatially explicit simulations and analytic models provide equivalent results, and to use simulation approaches to investigate the evolution of dispersal kernel shape in spatially complex habitats. Our model could be modified in various ways to investigate dispersal evolution in other species and seascapes, providing new insights into patterns of marine larval dispersal.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">README</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains readme and notes for all files.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">README.txt</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">files_runsims</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains Matlab code (.m files) for running model simulation data used for Figures 2-4 in the paper.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">output_environments</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains Matlab data files (.mat files) for each type of simulation environment.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">output_simulations</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains Matlab data files (.mat files) for each individual-based simulation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">files_plotsims</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains Matlab code (.m files) for plotting Figures 2-4 in the paper, using the above .mat files.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">files_plotcomparisons</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains Matlab code (.m files), R code (.R files) and data files (.csv) to compare simulated and empirical data and to plot Figure 5 in the paper.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2018-11-07","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/QSMRTYkWBgtT63mX_545mXZ8q9SCkevAZSKW3TbzM90",7568,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Allison K."",""lastName"":""Shaw"",""affiliation"":""University of Minnesota"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/017zqws13""},{""firstName"":""Cassidy C."",""lastName"":""D'Aloia"",""affiliation"":""Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03zbnzt98""},{""firstName"":""Peter M."",""lastName"":""Buston"",""affiliation"":""Boston University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05qwgg493""}]","[""Ecology: evolutionary"",""Coral reef""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1086/701667""}]"

Linking genetic structure with the influences shaping it can improve understanding of how species respond to environmental change. Here, we used genome-scale data and demographic modelling to resolve the evolutionary history of Lednia tumana, a rare, aquatic insect endemic to alpine streams. We also employed a range of widely used data filtering approaches to quantify how they influenced population structure results.
Location: Alpine streams in the Rocky Mountains of Glacier National Park, Montana, USA.
Taxon: Lednia tumana, a stonefly (Order Plecoptera) in the family Nemouridae.
Methods: We generated single nucleotide polymorphism data through restriction-site associated DNA sequencing to assess contemporary patterns of genetic structure for 11 L. tumana populations. Using identified clusters, we assessed demographic history through model selection and parameter estimation in a coalescent framework. During population structure analyses, we filtered our data to assess the influence of singletons, missing data and total number of markers on results.
Results: Contemporary patterns of population structure indicate that L. tumana exhibits a pattern of isolation-by-distance among populations within three genetic clusters that align with geography. Mean pairwise genetic differentiation (FST) among populations was 0.033. Coalescent-based demographic modelling supported divergence with gene flow among genetic clusters since the end of the Pleistocene (~13-17 kya), likely reflecting the south-to-north recession of ice sheets that accumulated during the Wisconsin glaciation.
Main conclusions: We identified a link between glacial retreat, evolutionary history and patterns of genetic diversity for a range-restricted stonefly imperiled by climate change. This finding included a history of divergence with gene flow, an unexpected conclusion for a mountaintop species. Beyond L. tumana, this study demonstrates the complexity of assessing genetic structure for weakly differentiated species, shows the degree to which rare alleles and missing data may influence results, and highlights the usefulness of genome-scale data to extend population genetic inquiry in non-model species.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Dryad Accession for Hotaling et al. 2017, Journal of Biogeography</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Relevant files for the associated study: input files for PLINK and Fastsimcoal2, a key of individuals/populations, and raw SNP catalog as output by STACKS with a whitelist for the loci/SNPs used in this study.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Hotaling_2017_Dryad.zip</br></div></div>",2,"submitted","Published","2018-10-12","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/GeA7w1XNQlNtEXJM7gQWDU9QW3lL69BeuOddlYdjVFA",19324,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Scott"",""lastName"":""Hotaling"",""email"":""scott.hotaling@wsu.edu"",""affiliation"":""University of Kentucky"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02k3smh20""},{""firstName"":""Clint C."",""lastName"":""Muhlfeld"",""affiliation"":""University of Montana"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/0078xmk34""},{""firstName"":""J.

High demand coupled with deforestation have caused a decrease in natural teak forests, and future supplies will be reliant on teak plantations. Hence, selection of teak tree varieties for clonal propagation with superior growth performance is of great importance, and access to high-quality genetic and genomic resources can accelerate the selection process by identifying genes underlying desired traits.
Findings: To facilitate teak research and variety improvement, we generated a highly contiguous, chromosomal-scale genome assembly using high-coverage PacBio long reads coupled with high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. Of the 18 teak chromosomes, we generated 17 near-complete pseudomolecules with one chromosome present as two chromosome arm scaffolds. Genome annotation yielded 31,168 genes encoding 46,826 gene models, of which, 39,930 and 41,155 had Pfam domain and expression evidence, respectively. We identified 14 clusters of tandem-duplicated terpene synthases (TPSs), genes central to the biosynthesis of terpenes which are involved in plant defense and pollinator attraction. Transcriptome analysis revealed 10 TPSs highly expressed in woody tissues, of which, 8 were in tandem, revealing the importance of resolving tandemly duplicated genes and the quality of the assembly and annotation. We also validated the enzymatic activity of four TPSs to demonstrate the function of key TPSs.
Conclusions: In summary, this high-quality chromosomal-scale assembly and functional annotation of the teak genome will facilitate the discovery of candidate genes related to traits critical for sustainable production of teak and for anti-insecticidal natural products.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4

The domesticated long-tailed chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) is a well-suited and appropriate animal model of pregnancy that often will carry only one offspring and has a long gestation period of 105–115 days. Furthermore, the chinchilla placenta is of the haemomonochorial labyrinthine type and is therefore comparable to the human villous haemomonochorial placenta. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility in laboratory settings, and demonstrated the potential of the pregnant chinchilla as an animal model for obstetric research and its potential usefulness for non-invasive measurements in the placenta. We demonstrate measurements of the placental and fetal metabolism (demonstrated in vivo by hyperpolarized MRI and in vitro by qPCR analyses), placental vessels (demonstrated ex vivo by contrast-enhanced CT angiography) and overall anatomy (demonstrated in vivo by whole-body CT).","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Imaging data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data contains (zip format files): 1) reconstructed MRI data (General Electric MRI system) and regions-of-interests files.

However, the identification of such groups has largely been based on qualitative, post hoc analyses. We develop here two methods (PPS, K-F ANOVA) for the analysis of codistributed species that, given a group of species with a shared pattern of diversification, allow empiricists to identify those taxa that do not codiversify (i.e., ""outlier"" species). The identification of outlier species makes it possible to jointly estimate the evolutionary history of co-diversifying taxa. To evaluate the approaches presented here, we collected data from Páramo dipterans, identified outlier species, and estimated a ""community tree"" from species that are identified as having co-diversified. Our results demonstrate that dipteran communities from different Páramo habitats in the same mountain range are more closely related than communities in other ranges. We also conduct simulation testing to evaluate this approach. Results suggest that our approach provides a useful addition to comparative phylogeographic methods, while identifying aspects of the analysis that require careful interpretation. In particular, both the PPS and K-F ANOVA perform acceptably when there are one or two outlier species, but less so as the number of outliers increase. This is likely a function of the corresponding degradation of the signal of community divergence; without a strong signal from a co-diversifying community, there is no dominant pattern from which to detect and outlier species. For this reason, both the magnitude of K-F distance distribution and outside knowledge about the phylogeographic history of each putative member of the community should be considered when interpreting results.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Community_Trees</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">1.

Allelic variances have been thought to be the sole cause of this heterogeneity. Here, we systematically examine the consequences of gaining and losing single or multiple chromosomes to show that the aneuploid state causes non-genetic phenotypic variability. Yeast cell populations harboring the same defined aneuploidy exhibit heterogeneity in cell-cycle progression and response to environmental perturbations. Variability increases with degree of aneuploidy and is partly due to gene copy number imbalances, suggesting that subtle changes in gene expression impact the robustness of biological networks and cause alternate behaviors when they occur across many genes. As inbred trisomic mice also exhibit variable phenotypes, we further propose that non-genetic individuality is a universal characteristic of the aneuploid state that may contribute to variability in presentation and treatment responses of diseases caused by aneuploidy.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">FC Dataset: steady-state GAL pathway induction</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw FCS files and MATLAB analysis code.

Analysis for detection should be comprehensive, timely and based on routinely available tumor samples. Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of targeted multigene next-generation sequencing (TM-NGS) in characterizing gastrointestinal cancer molecular heterogeneity. Methods: 35 gastrointestinal tract tumors, five of each intestinal type gastric carcinomas, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, ampulla of Vater carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, cholangiocarcinomas, pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumors were assessed for mutations in 46 cancer-associated genes, using Ion Torrent semiconductor-based TM-NGS. One ampulla of Vater carcinoma cell line and one hepatic carcinosarcoma served to assess assay sensitivity. TP53, PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations were validated by conventional Sanger sequencing. Results: TM-NGS yielded overlapping results on matched fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, with a mutation detection limit of 1% for fresh-frozen high molecular weight DNA and 2% for FFPE partially degraded DNA. At least one somatic mutation was observed in all tumors tested; multiple alterations were detected in 20/35 (57%) tumors. Seven cancers displayed significant differences in allelic frequencies for distinct mutations, indicating the presence of intratumor molecular heterogeneity; this was confirmed on selected samples by immunohistochemistry of p53 and Smad4, showing concordance with mutational analysis. Conclusions: TM-NGS is able to detect and quantitate multiple gene alterations from limited amounts of DNA, moving one step closer to a next-generation histopathologic diagnosis that integrates morphologic, immunophenotypic, and multigene mutational analysis on routinely processed tissues, essential for personalized cancer therapy.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4

Advances in high-field MRI allow for the non-invasive identification of hippocampal substructure. These approaches, however, demand time-consuming manual segmentation that relies heavily on anatomical expertise. Here, we share manual labels and associated high-resolution MRI data (MNI-HISUB25; submillimetric T1- and T2-weighted images, detailed sequence information, and stereotaxic probabilistic anatomical maps) based on 25 healthy subjects. Data were acquired on a widely available 3 Tesla MRI system using a 32 phased-array head coil. The protocol divided the hippocampal formation into three subregions: subicular complex, merged Cornu Ammonis 1, 2 and 3 (CA1-3) subfields, and CA4-dentate gyrus (CA4-DG). Segmentation was guided by consistent intensity and morphology characteristics of the densely myelinated molecular layer together with few geometry-based boundaries flexible to overall mesiotemporal anatomy, and achieved excellent intra-/inter-rater reliability (Dice index ≥90/87%). The dataset can inform neuroimaging assessments of the mesiotemporal lobe and help to develop segmentation algorithms relevant for basic and clinical neurosciences.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">README.txt</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Readme file.

For example, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a commonly used method for the explicit comparison of alternate demographic histories, but it is limited by the “curse of dimensionality” and issues related to the simulation and summarization of data when applied to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data sets. We implement here several improvements to overcome these difficulties. We use a Random Forest (RF) classifier for model selection to circumvent the curse of dimensionality and apply a binned representation of the multidimensional site frequency spectrum (mSFS) to address issues related to the simulation and summarization of large SNP data sets. We evaluate the performance of these improvements using simulation and find low overall error rates (~7%). We then apply the approach to data from Haplotrema vancouverense, a land snail endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Fifteen demographic models were compared, and our results support a model of recent dispersal from coastal to inland rainforests. Our results demonstrate that binning is an effective strategy for the construction of a mSFS and imply that the statistical power of RF when applied to demographic model selection is at least comparable to traditional ABC algorithms. Importantly, by combining these strategies, large sets of models with differing numbers of populations can be evaluated.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4

Two central and related questions can be posed in regard to modularity: How does modularity appear in the first place, and what forces are responsible for keeping and/or changing modular patterns? We approached these questions using a quantitative genetics simulation framework, building on previous results obtained with bivariate systems and extending them to multivariate systems. We developed an individual-based model capable of simulating many traits controlled by many loci with variable pleiotropic relations between them, expressed in populations subject to mutation, recombination, drift, and selection. We used this model to study the problem of the emergence of modularity, and hereby show that drift and stabilizing selection are inefficient at creating modular variational structures. We also demonstrate that directional selection can have marked effects on the modular structure between traits, actively promoting a restructuring of genetic variation in the selected population and potentially facilitating the response to selection. Furthermore, we give examples of complex covariation created by simple regimes of combined directional and stabilizing selection and show that stabilizing selection is important in the maintenance of established covariation patterns. Our results are in full agreement with previous results for two-trait systems and further extend them to include scenarios of greater complexity. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary consequences of modular patterns being molded by directional selection.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">C code for the simulations</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Requires GSL to be instaled in the system.

We compared gene expression in Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, two closely related co-dominant C4 grasses responsible for the majority of ecosystem function, using RNA-seq.</p>

<p>We compared Trinity assemblies within each species to determine annotated functions of transcripts responding to drought. Subsequently, we compared homologous annotated gene-groups across the two species using cross-species meta-level analysis and functional clustering based on key terms. The majority of variation was found between species, as opposed to between drought and watered treatments. However, there is evidence for differential responses; Andropogon allocated gene expression differently compared to Sorghastrum, suggesting Andropogon focuses on stress alleviation (such as oxygen radical scavenging) rather than prevention.</p>

<p>In contrast, Sorghastrum may employ a drought avoidance strategy by modulating osmotic response, especially with hormonal regulation. We found Sorghastrum tended to be more sensitive within 10 key gene-groups related to stress, abscisic acid, and trichomes, suggesting gene expression may mechanistically parallel sensitivity at the physiological level. Our findings corroborate phenotypic and physiological differences in the field, and may help explain the phenotypic mechanisms of these two species in the tallgrass prairie community under future drought scenarios.</p>

This observation is so consistent that it constitutes one of the few patterns in biology that may be regarded as a ‘rule’ and Haldane (Haldane 1922 J. Genet. 12, 101–109. (doi:10.1007/BF02983075)) proposed that it might be driven by selection against recombination in the sex chromosomes. Yet differences in recombination rates between the sexes (heterochiasmy) have also been reported in hermaphroditic species that lack sex chromosomes. In plants—the vast majority of which are hermaphroditic—selection at the haploid stage has been proposed to drive heterochiasmy. Yet few data are available for hermaphroditic animals, and barely any for hermaphroditic vertebrates. Here, we leverage reciprocal crosses between two black hamlets (Hypoplectrus nigricans, Serranidae), simultaneously hermaphroditic reef fishes from the wider Caribbean, to generate high-density egg- and sperm-specific linkage maps for each parent. We find globally higher recombination rates in the eggs, with dramatically pronounced heterochiasmy at the chromosome peripheries. We suggest that this pattern may be due to female meiotic drive, and that this process may be an important source of heterochiasmy in animals. We also identify a large non-recombining region that may play a role in speciation and local adaptation in Hypoplectrus.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 1 (both sexes)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 1 (both sexes)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_1_both_sexes.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 2 (both sexes)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 2 (both sexes)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_2_both_sexes.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 1 (eggs)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 1 (eggs)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_1_eggs.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 1 (sperm)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 1 (sperm)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_1_sperm.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 2 (eggs)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 2 (eggs)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_2_eggs.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Map for parent 2 (sperm)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Linkage map for parent 2 (sperm)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Parent_2_sperm.xlsx</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">RAD demultiplexed filtered data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">RAD data, demultiplexed and filtered (read 1)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">RAD_demultiplexed_filtered_data.zip</br></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2016-11-15","2020-06-30","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/S95pNy2aAVfEfap9_kGCbG3ArGxBhJspVaYmwJLGDOQ",22248,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Loukas"",""lastName"":""Theodosiou"",""affiliation"":""Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/0534re684""},{""firstName"":""W.

While it has been proposed that alpha band (8–13 Hz) activity serves to route information to downstream regions by inhibiting neuronal processing in task-irrelevant regions, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we investigate how neuronal oscillations detected by electroencephalography in visual areas during working memory encoding serve to gate information reflected in the simultaneously recorded blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging in downstream ventral regions. We used a paradigm in which 16 participants were presented with faces and landscapes in the right and left hemifields; one hemifield was attended and the other unattended. We observed that decreased alpha power contralateral to the attended object predicted the BOLD signal representing the attended object in ventral object-selective regions. Furthermore, increased alpha power ipsilateral to the attended object predicted a decrease in the BOLD signal representing the unattended object. We also found that the BOLD signal in the dorsal attention network inversely correlated with visual alpha power. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that oscillations in the alpha band are implicated in the gating of information from the visual cortex to the ventral stream, as reflected in the representationally specific BOLD signal. This link of sensory alpha to downstream activity provides a neurophysiological substrate for the mechanism of selective attention during stimulus processing, which not only boosts the attended information but also suppresses distraction. Although previous studies have shown a relation between the BOLD signal from the dorsal attention network and the alpha band at rest, we demonstrate such a relation during a visuospatial task, indicating that the dorsal attention network exercises top-down control of visual alpha activity.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4

Interactions between habitat-formers and their microbiomes are fundamental for host functioning and resilience, but how such relationships will change in future conditions is largely unknown. We investigated independent and interactive effects of warming and acidification on a large brown seaweed, the kelp Ecklonia radiata, and its associated microbiome in experimental mesocosms. Microbial communities were affected by warming and, during the first week, by acidification. During the second week, kelp developed disease-like symptoms previously observed in the field. The tissue of some kelp blistered, bleached and eventually degraded, particularly under the acidification treatments, affecting photosynthetic efficiency. Microbial communities differed between blistered and healthy kelp for all treatments, except for those under future conditions of warming and acidification, which after two weeks resembled assemblages associated with healthy hosts. This indicates that changes in the microbiome were not easily predictable as the severity of future climate scenarios increased. Future ocean conditions can change kelp microbiomes and may lead to host disease, with potentially cascading impacts on associated ecosystems.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Amplicon sequences of microbial communities on the surface of ecklonia radiata under different environmental conditions</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This data includes bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences of microbial communities on the surface of Ecklonia radiata under different environmental scenarios.

DNA-based techniques can expand the utility of these collections to explore their demographic and evolutionary history, temporal changes in their abundance, and pathogen dynamics. Using museum collections of the non-model bee species Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa Say 1837 (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Eucerini), we developed a standard minimally-destructive and budget-friendly protocol to extract DNA and amplify common gene-fragments for barcoding, phylogenetic analysis, and pathogens. We also generated genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) libraries for population structure analyses. We systematically studied the effect of specimen age (≤10 years ago) and tissue type (whole bees vs. abdomen) on DNA quality, single gene-fragment amplification, and SNP calling. We found that all analyses were achievable with both tissue types, yet with variable levels of efficiency because of general DNA degradation. Specifically, we found that not all samples yielded satisfactory results for molecular studies; however, we did not find a systematic effect of specimen age on DNA quality which is encouraging for future studies involving historical specimens. We report the first evidence for the presence of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema spp. in squash bees, opening a window for the study of historical changes in disease pressure in this important agricultural pollinator. Our protocols can be used as a template for the design of future experiments that extract multiple pieces of information using DNA-based methods from insect museum stored specimens.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">README</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">ddRAD sequences and metadata from Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa (Hymenoptera: Apidae) males used in:

However, the subthreshold dynamics underlying its emergence in the cortex of awake animals remain unclear. Here, we characterized the intracellular dynamics of PVs and PYRs during spontaneous and visually evoked gamma activity in layers 2/3 of V1 of awake mice using targeted patch-clamp recordings and synchronous local field potentials (LFPs). Strong gamma activity patterned in short bouts (one to three cycles), occurred when PVs and PYRs were depolarizing and entrained their membrane potential dynamics regardless of the presence of visual stimulation. PV firing phase locked unconditionally to gamma activity. However, PYRs only phase locked to visually evoked gamma bouts. Taken together, our results indicate that gamma activity corresponds to short pulses of correlated background synaptic activity synchronizing the output of cortical neurons depending on external sensory drive.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_ICData1</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Current-clamp data for PV cells (Set 1 of 3)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_ICData2</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Current-clamp data for PV cells (Set 1 of 3)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_ICData3</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Current-clamp data for PV cells (Set 3 of 3)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_IC_Subthreshold</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Current-clamp Subthreshold data for PV cells</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_VC+10Data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Voltage-Clamp Data at +10mV for PV cells</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PV_VC-80Data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Voltage-Clamp Data at -80mV for PV cells</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">PYR_IC</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Current-Clamp Data for PYR cells</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Fig1-4</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Analyses and Scripts used to compute and generate results from Fig1-4</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Fig5-6</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Analyses and Scripts used to compute and generate results from Fig5-6</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">SupFig1-3</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Analyses and Scripts used to compute and generate results from SupFig1-3</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">SupFig4-6</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Analyses and Scripts used to compute and generate results from SupFig4-6</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Utilities</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Matlab Scripts written and used for the analysis</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">ReadMe</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Information File describing each of the above files and how to use the scripts correctly</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2016-02-26","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/5xZTIgQVN9lVw4cQC-UeTtOuicSmJOcMZCQnweKq3_s",727,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Quentin"",""lastName"":""Perrenoud"",""affiliation"":""University of Amsterdam"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04dkp9463""},{""firstName"":""Cyriel M.

The environmental effects of ischemia on chromatin nanostructure were investigated using single molecule localization microscopy of DNA binding dyes and of acetylated histones, by the sensitivity of chromatin to digestion with DNAseI, and by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of core and linker histones. Results: Short-term oxygen and nutrient deprivation of the cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 induces a previously undescribed chromatin architecture, consisting of large, chromatin-sparse voids interspersed between DNA-dense hollow helicoid structures 40–700 nm in dimension. The chromatin compaction is reversible, and upon restitution of normoxia and nutrients, chromatin transiently adopts a more open structure than in untreated cells. The compacted state of chromatin reduces transcription, while the open chromatin structure induced upon recovery provokes a transitory increase in transcription. Digestion of chromatin with DNAseI confirms that oxygen and nutrient deprivation induces compaction of chromatin. Chromatin compaction is associated with depletion of ATP and redistribution of the polyamine pool into the nucleus. FRAP demonstrates that core histones are not displaced from compacted chromatin; however, the mobility of linker histone H1 is considerably reduced, to an extent that far exceeds the difference in histone H1 mobility between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Conclusions: These studies exemplify the dynamic capacity of chromatin architecture to physically respond to environmental conditions, directly link cellular energy status to chromatin compaction and provide insight into the effect ischemia has on the nuclear architecture of cells.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Part 1 of 11 Zip file of primary data for ""A transient ischaemic environment induces reversible compaction of chromatin""</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">All image sets for the Vybrant Violet / H3K14 ac Single Molecule Localization Microscopy work (UT:9 expts; OND:12 expts; 5min:10 expts; 15min:9 expts, 60min:10 expts; 240min:9 expts).

Classic studies propose that templates are encoded in sustained activity of sensory neurons. However, stimulus encoding is itself dynamic, tracing a complex trajectory through activity space. Which part of this trajectory is pre-activated to reflect the template? Here we recorded magneto- and electroencephalography during a visual target-detection task, and used pattern analyses to decode template, stimulus, and decision-variable representation. Our findings ran counter to the dominant model of sustained pre-activation. Instead, template information emerged transiently around stimulus onset and quickly subsided. Cross-generalization between stimulus and template coding, indicating a shared neural representation, occurred only briefly. Our results are compatible with the proposal that template representation relies on a matched filter, transforming input into task-appropriate output. This proposal was consistent with a signed difference response at the perceptual decision stage, which can be explained by a simple neural model.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">S01_EEG</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Subject 1.

Nevertheless, E&R studies in Drosophila melanogaster have frequently resulted in inordinate numbers of candidate SNPs, particularly for complex traits. Here, we contrast the genomic signature of adaptation following ∼60 generations in a novel hot environment for D. melanogaster and D. simulans. For D. simulans, the regions carrying putatively selected loci were far more distinct, and thus harbored fewer false positives, than those in D. melanogaster. We propose that species without segregating inversions and higher recombination rates, such as D. simulans, are better suited for E&R studies that aim to characterize the genetic variants underlying the adaptive response.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Dsim_3reps_F0F60_majorChr_downsampled</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Sync file of allele coverage for Drosophila simulans SNPs in major chromosome arms (X, 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R).

Here, we characterize the phylogenetic turnover of poly-adenylated transcripts in a comprehensive sampling of taxa of the mouse (genus Mus), spanning a phylogenetic distance of 10 Myr. Using deep RNA sequencing we find that at a given sequencing depth transcriptome coverage becomes saturated within a taxon, but keeps extending when compared between taxa, even at this very shallow phylogenetic level. Our data show a high turnover of transcriptional states between taxa and that no major transcript-free islands exist across evolutionary time. This suggests that the entire genome can be transcribed into poly-adenylated RNA when viewed at an evolutionary time scale. We conclude that any part of the non-coding genome can potentially become subject to evolutionary functionalization via de novo gene evolution within relatively short evolutionary time spans.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Genome coverage of the mm10 mouse reference genome of four closely related species</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genome coverage of the mm10 mouse reference genome.

Most expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) occur at the same genomic location as methylation QTLs (cis-meQTLs), suggesting a common causal variant and shared mechanism.  Using DNA and RNA from peripheral blood of Bangladeshi individuals, here we use co-localization methods to identify eQTL-meQTL pairs likely to share a causal variant. We use partial correlation and mediation analyses to identify >400 of these pairs showing evidence of a causal relationship between expression and methylation (i.e., shared mechanism) with many additional pairs we are underpowered to detect.  These co-localized pairs are enriched for SNPs showing opposite associations with expression and methylation, although a many SNPs affect multiple CpGs in opposite directions.  This work demonstrates the pervasiveness of co-regulated expression and methylation in the human genome.

To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in ‘pair’ and ‘transect’ sampling strategies. We compared FST outlier and genetic–environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (FST or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and FST had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation. Our results can inform sampling designs for studies of local adaptation and have important implications for the interpretation of genome scans based on landscape data.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Zip file containing datasets and results</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">See the README file.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">dryad.zip</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2015-02-03","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/Xlgu9VQ7wLqBtTSREHkQANMa4kUgHRxuyO_qD5V6w1s",33212,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Katie E."",""lastName"":""Lotterhos"",""affiliation"":""University of British Columbia"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03rmrcq20""},{""firstName"":""Michael C."",""lastName"":""Whitlock"",""affiliation"":""University of British Columbia"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03rmrcq20""}]","[""spatial statistics"",""genome scans"",""sampling design""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13100""}]"

This shift towards the use of natives has highlighted a need to increase the diversity of materials available. A key problem is agreeing on how many, and which, new accessions should be developed. Here we describe new methods that address this problem. Our methods use climate data to calculate a climate similarity index between two points in a defined extent. This index can be used to predict relative performance of available accessions at a target site. In addition, the index can be used in combination with standard cluster analysis algorithms to quantify and maximize climate coverage (mean climate similarity), given a modeled range extent and a specified number of accessions. We demonstrate the utility of this latter feature by applying it to the extents of 11 Western North American species with proven or potential use in restoration. First, a species-specific seed transfer map can be readily generated for a species by predicting performance for accessions currently available; this map can be readily updated to accommodate new accessions. Next, the increase in climate coverage achieved by adding successive accessions can be explored, yielding information that managers can use to balance ecologic and economic considerations in determining how many accessions to develop. This approach identifies sampling sites, referred to as climate centers, which contribute unique, complementary climate coverage to accessions on hand, thus providing explicit sampling guidance for both germplasm preservation and research. We examine how these, and other, features of our approach add to existing methods used to guide plant materials development and use. Finally, we discuss how these new methods provide a framework that could be used to coordinate native plant materials development, evaluation, and use across agencies, regions, and research groups.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Climate Similarity Support Scripts</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This compressed file contains scripts and supporting data necessary to reproduce the analyses and products associated with Doherty et al.

The origin of the snake-like body form, with its deregionalized pre-cloacal axial skeleton, has been explained as either homogenization of Hox gene expression domains9, or retention of standard vertebrate Hox domains with alteration of downstream expression that suppresses development of distinct regions. Both models assume a highly regionalized ancestor, but the extent of deregionalization of the primaxial domain (vertebrae, dorsal ribs) of the skeleton in snake-like body forms has never been analysed. Here we combine geometric morphometrics and maximum-likelihood analysis to show that the pre-cloacal primaxial domain of elongate, limb-reduced lizards and snakes is not deregionalized compared with limbed taxa, and that the phylogenetic structure of primaxial morphology in reptiles does not support a loss of regionalization in the evolution of snakes. We demonstrate that morphometric regional boundaries correspond to mapped gene expression domains in snakes, suggesting that their primaxial domain is patterned by a normally functional Hox code. Comparison of primaxial osteology in fossil and modern amniotes with Hox gene distributions within Amniota indicates that a functional, sequentially expressed Hox code patterned a subtle morphological gradient along the anterior–posterior axis in stem members of amniote clades and extant lizards, including snakes. The highly regionalized skeletons of extant archosaurs and mammals result from independent evolution in the Hox code and do not represent ancestral conditions for clades with snake-like body forms. The developmental origin of snakes is best explained by decoupling of the primaxial and abaxial domains and by increases in somite number, not by changes in the function of primaxial Hox genes.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Morphometric data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Morphometric data files for Alligator, Mus, and squamates</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Archive.zip</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2015-12-05","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/h6TAL6n-Ll4TIbaqPicgan_XTMJiZeUYLKipOYOo1Co",10654,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Jason J."",""lastName"":""Head"",""affiliation"":""University of Nebraska - Lincoln"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/043mer456""}]","[""Amniota"",""Hox gene"",""Serpentes"",""Squamata"",""Snakes"",""vertebrae""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14042""}]"

To develop effective analgesics, experimental human and animal models of pain are critical. Topically/intra-dermally applied capsaicin induces hyperalgesia and allodynia to thermal and tactile stimuli that mimics chronic pain and is a useful translation from preclinical research to clinical investigation. Many behavioral and self-report studies of pain have exploited the use of the capsaicin pain model, but objective biomarker correlates of the capsaicin augmented nociceptive response in nonhuman primates remains to be explored. Methodology: Here we establish an aversive capsaicin-induced fMRI model using non-noxious heat stimuli in Cynomolgus monkeys (n = 8). BOLD fMRI data were collected during thermal challenge (ON:20 s/42°C; OFF:40 s/35°C, 4-cycle) at baseline and 30 min post-capsaicin (0.1 mg, topical, forearm) application. Tail withdrawal behavioral studies were also conducted in the same animals using 42°C or 48°C water bath pre- and post- capsaicin application (0.1 mg, subcutaneous, tail). Principal Findings: Group comparisons between pre- and post-capsaicin application revealed significant BOLD signal increases in brain regions associated with the ‘pain matrix’, including somatosensory, frontal, and cingulate cortices, as well as the cerebellum (paired t-test, p<0.02, n = 8), while no significant change was found after the vehicle application. The tail withdrawal behavioral study demonstrated a significant main effect of temperature and a trend towards capsaicin induced reduction of latency at both temperatures. Conclusions: These findings provide insights into the specific brain regions involved with aversive, ‘pain-like’, responses in a nonhuman primate model. Future studies may employ both behavioral and fMRI measures as translational biomarkers to gain deeper understanding of pain processing and evaluate the preclinical efficacy of novel analgesics.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Raw Data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Image raw epi data, group activation map, activation volume, PSC,Tail withdrawal data</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Data.zip</br></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2017-05-25","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/mGt3N_Ii83VNbiBFOPZlqKheNzLwmgnPDomG_2KFsZU",19656,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Abu Bakar Ali"",""lastName"":""Asad"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Stephanie"",""lastName"":""Seah"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Richard"",""lastName"":""Baumgartner"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Dai"",""lastName"":""Feng"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Andres"",""lastName"":""Jensen"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Elaine"",""lastName"":""Manigbas""},{""firstName"":""Brian"",""lastName"":""Henry"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Andrea"",""lastName"":""Houghton"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Jeffrey L."",""lastName"":""Evelhoch"",""affiliation"":""Merck (Singapore)"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05cq2am04""},{""firstName"":""Stuart W.

Some of the expected changes result from processes whose effects will be difficult to alter, such as global climate change. We present a novel framework in which we use models to (1) identify the ecological changes from these difficult-to-alter processes, as well as (2) the potential conservation measures that are best able to compensate for these changes. We illustrated this framework with the case of an endangered caribou population in Québec, Canada. We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action. By evaluating conservation actions via landscape use simulated by an individual-based model, we were able to identify compensatory conservation options for an endangered species facing climate change.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Habitat Quality Maps for caribou movement models</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Archive of 24 tifs of seasonal (winter&summef) habitat quality maps for 12 management/climate change scenarios, as detailed in the manuscript and supplementary material.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">rasterMapsScenarios.rar</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2018-11-21","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/6N0QB8e9IRfXWVQ40hnTJ-ID55MBq9HigwYkMFqvYJY",28821,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Sarah"",""lastName"":""Bauduin"",""affiliation"":""Université Laval"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04sjchr03""},{""firstName"":""Eliot"",""lastName"":""McIntire"",""affiliation"":""Université Laval"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04sjchr03""},{""firstName"":""Martin-Hughes"",""lastName"":""St-Laurent"",""affiliation"":""Center for Northern Studies"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/01q8ytn75""},{""firstName"":""Steven G."",""lastName"":""Cumming"",""affiliation"":""Université Laval"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04sjchr03""}]","[""Anthropocene"",""conservation"",""protected areas"",""movement potential"",""Rangifer tarandus caribou"",""road restoration"",""Caribou""]","[{""place"":""Canada""},{""place"":""Gaspésie""},{""place"":""Québec""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34822-9""}]"

These complex interactions between mimics, models and predators can explain similarities between organisms beyond the often-mechanistic constraints typically invoked in studies of convergent evolution. However, quantitative studies of protective mimicry typically focus on static traits (e.g. colour and shape) rather than on dynamic traits like locomotion. Here, we use high-speed cameras and behavioural experiments to investigate the role of locomotor behaviour in mimicry by the ant-mimicking jumping spider Myrmarachne formicaria, comparing its movement to that of ants and non-mimicking spiders. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find mimics walk using all eight legs, raising their forelegs like ant antennae only when stationary. Mimics exhibited winding trajectories (typical wavelength = 5–10 body lengths), which resemble the winding patterns of ants specifically engaged in pheromone-trail following, although mimics walked on chemically inert surfaces. Mimics also make characteristically short (approx. 100 ms) pauses. Our analysis suggests that this makes mimics appear ant-like to observers with slow visual systems. Finally, behavioural experiments with predatory spiders yield results consistent with the protective mimicry hypothesis. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic behaviours and observer perception in mimicry.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">General README</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This general README file provides an overall description of the other files present in this repository.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Dryad data repo README.txt</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Behavior</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data related to behavior experiments presented in the manuscript.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">HighSpeed</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data related to high-speed (limb kinematics) experiments presented in the manuscript.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">OverallMovement</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data related to overall movement experiments presented in the manuscript.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2017-06-06","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/nZ_bMbI2ee_YCbUiQ7f8zNK1Vaj0Bbdtxo1OrjBh6Gk",26142,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Paul S."",""lastName"":""Shamble"",""affiliation"":""Harvard University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03vek6s52""},{""firstName"":""Ron R."",""lastName"":""Hoy"",""affiliation"":""Cornell University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05bnh6r87""},{""firstName"":""Itai"",""lastName"":""Cohen"",""affiliation"":""Cornell University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05bnh6r87""},{""firstName"":""Tsevi"",""lastName"":""Beatus"",""affiliation"":""Hebrew University of Jerusalem"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03qxff017""}]","[""Batesian mimicry"",""ant"",""Myrmarachne formicaria"",""ant-mimicry""]","[{""place"":""New York""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0308""}]"

Here we sequence the genomes of seven species of ants, three that have convergently evolved obligate plant–ant mutualism and four closely related species of non-mutualists. Comparing these sequences, we investigate how genome evolution is shaped by mutualistic behaviour. We find that rates of molecular evolution are higher in the mutualists genome wide, a characteristic apparently not the result of demography. Our results suggest that the intimate relationships of obligate mutualists may lead to selective pressures similar to those seen in parasites, thereby increasing rates of evolution.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">pgra_genome_v1.0</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">pgra_OGSv1.0_CDS</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">CDS from annotation version 1.0.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">pgra_OGSv1.0_pep</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Protein sequences from version 1.0 of the annotation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">pgra_OGSv1.0_genes</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">GFF from version 1.0 of the annotation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">aligned_pseudomyrmex_genomes.tar</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Six species of Pseudomyrmex were assembled based on alignments to the P. gracilis reference.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">aligned_pseudomyrmex_genes.tar</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Gene alignments for the seven Pseudomyrmex species sequenced.

Tolerance to environmental stress, resulting from wind abrasion and desiccation towards windswept ridges or reduced growing season due to prolonged snow cover towards snowbeds, is an important ecological mechanism in this gradient. The extent to which belowground fungal communities are structured by the same topographic gradient, and the eventual mechanisms involved, are less well known. In this study, we analyzed variation in fungal diversity and community composition associated with roots of the ectomycorrhizal plant Bistorta vivipara along the ridge-to-snowbed gradient. We collected root samples from fifty B. vivipara plants in ten plots in an alpine area in central Norway. The fungal communities were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing analyses of tag encoded ITS1 amplicons. A distinct gradient in the fungal community composition was found that coincided with variation from ridge to snowbeds. This gradient was paralleled by change in soil content of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. A large proportion (66%) of the detected 801 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were ascomycetes, while basidiomycetes dominated quantitatively (i.e., with respect to number of reads). Numerous fungal OTUs, many with taxonomic affinity to Sebacinales, Cortinarius and Meliniomyces, showed distinct affinities either to ridge or to snowbed plots, indicating habitat specialization. The compositional turnover of fungal communities along the gradient was not paralleled by a gradient in species richness.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">L1.sff</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">.SFF file for lane one run on the 454 platform.

Mycorrhizal associations facilitate plant nutrient acquisition and water uptake and may therefore be particularly ecologically important in nutrition-poor and dry environments, such as parts of the Arctic. Similarly, endophytic root associates are thought to play a protective role, increasing plants' stress tolerance, and likely have an important ecosystem function. Despite the importance of these root-associated fungi, little is known about their host specificity in the Arctic. We investigated the host specificity of root-associated fungi in the common, widely distributed arctic plant species Bistorta vivipara, Salix polaris and Dryas octopetala in the High Arctic archipelago Svalbard. High-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplified from whole root systems generated no evidence of host specificity and no spatial autocorrelation within two 3 m × 3 m sample plots. The lack of spatial structure at small spatial scales indicates that Common Mycelial Networks (CMNs) are rare in marginal arctic environments. Moreover, no significant differences in fungal OTU richness were observed across the three plant species, although their root system characteristics (size, biomass) differed considerably. Reasons for lack of host specificity could be that association with generalist fungi may allow arctic plants to more rapidly and easily colonize newly available habitats, and it may be favourable to establish symbiotic relationships with fungi possessing different physiological attributes.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">L1.sff</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">.SFF file for lane one run on the 454 platform.

All genetic markers consistently show extensive genetic variation within and genetic depletion outside the Carpathians. The species distribution model suggests that most of the current range was unsuitable at the Last Glacial Maximum, but a small suitable area remained in the Carpathians. Triturus cristatus dramatically expanded its postglacial range, colonizing much of temperate Eurasia from a glacial refugium in the Carpathians. Within the Carpathians, T. cristatus persisted in multiple geographically discrete regions, providing further support for a Carpathian ‘refugia within refugia’ scenario.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Raw Ion Torrent reads in FASTQ format</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw Ion Torrent reads in FASTQ format</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">MHC_Ion torrent_fastq.zip</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Decoding table and an alignment of the MHC class II DAB haplotypes</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Decoding table and an alignment of the MHC class II DAB haplotypes</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">MHC_decoding_table_alignment.zip</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Input files for MrBayes, BEAST, Newhybrids, and BAPS</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Input files for MrBayes, BEAST, Newhybrids, and BAPS</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Input_files_genetics.zip</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Bioclimatic layers used for species distribution modelling</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Bioclimatic layers used for species distribution modelling</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Maxent_climate_layers.zip</br></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2014-10-08","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/CVPhgB26sEzA3nKivPLSYoyOlXlTxeUgC9sCHHWpSUw",339,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Ben"",""lastName"":""Wielstra"",""affiliation"":""University of Sheffield"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05krs5044""},{""firstName"":""Wiesław"",""lastName"":""Babik"",""affiliation"":""Jagiellonian University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03bqmcz70""},{""firstName"":""Jan W."",""lastName"":""Arntzen"",""affiliation"":""Naturalis Biodiversity Center"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/0566bfb96""}]","[""Last Glacial Maximum"",""Major histocompatibility complex"",""Mitochondrial DNA"",""Genetic depletion""]","[{""place"":""Carpathians""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12446""}]"

Even without such external perturbations, intrinsic sources like sensorimotor noise perturb the running motion incessantly, making each step variable. Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations.

Fat and soft tissue were each mobilized at a constant rate through the entire migration. Fat stores in birds embarking on migration were greater in the abdomen than thorax than chest. In contrast to previous studies indicating that abdominal fat was mobilized first, we found that fat from all areas was mobilized concurrently, but that abdominal fat was catabolized at a greater rate. We suggest why this pattern might be advantageous, consider whether inter-depot differences in fat composition might be involved, and note possible energetic consequences.

RecBCD is able to displace DNA binding proteins, suggesting that it generates high forces, but the specific role of each subunit in the force generation is unclear. Here, we present a novel optical tweezers assay that allows monitoring the activity of RecBCD's individual subunits, when they are part of an intact full complex. We show that RecBCD and its subunits are able to generate forces up to 25-40 pN without a significant effect on their velocity. Moreover, the isolated RecD translocates fast, but is a weak helicase with limited processivity. Experiments at a broad range of [ATP] and forces suggest that RecD unwinds DNA as a Brownian ratchet, rectified by ATP binding, and that the presence of the other subunits shifts the ratchet equilibrium towards the post-translocation state.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Dataset</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">The dataset includes a Matlab (“.mat”) file for each experimental trace measured in the optical tweezers.

The process is one of the most controversial topics of the speciation debate, particularly in tropical regions. Here, we investigate ecologically based divergence across an Amazonian ecotone in the electric fish, Steatogenys elegans. We combine phylogenetics, genome scans and population genetics with a recently developed individual-based evolutionary landscape genetics approach that incorporates selection. This framework is used to assess the relative contributions of geography and divergent natural selection between environments as biodiversity drivers. We report on two closely related and sympatric lineages that exemplify how divergent selection across a major Amazonian aquatic ecotone (i.e., between rivers with markedly different hydrochemical properties) may result in replicated ecologically mediated speciation. The results link selection across an ecological gradient with reproductive isolation and we propose that assortative mating based on water color may be driving the divergence. Divergence resulting from ecologically driven selection highlights the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity in studies of speciation in tropical regions. Furthermore, we show that framing ecological speciation in a spatially-explicit evolutionary landscape genetics framework provides an important first step in exploring a wide range of the potential effects of spatial dependence in natural selection.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">UniformSelection_CDPOP</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">1) No spatial selection gradient (‘uniform’): In this scenario, the three genotypes (AA, Aa, and aa) were being selected against, but uniformly across the ‘water color’ riverscape scenario, thus having no spatial dependency and allowing us to test for type I statistical errors.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">GentleSelection_CDPOP</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">2) Gentle spatial selection gradient (‘gentle’): Here, we used a ‘gentle’ spatial selection gradient corresponding to the three river color locations.

Great Britain has yielded a significant record of mammalian fossils from this interval, represented by numerous isolated jaws and teeth from the Bathonian of Oxfordshire and the Isle of Skye. This record captures a key period in early cladotherian evolution, with amphitheriids, peramurans and “stem zatherians” displaying intermediate talonid morphologies that document the evolutionary assembly of tribosphenic molars. We present a mandible with near-complete dentition from the late Bathonian (ca. 167.4–166.5 Ma) Kilmaluag Formation, near Elgol, Skye, representing the amphitheriid Palaeoxonodon ooliticus, previously known only from isolated teeth. The specimen sheds new light on the taxonomic diversity of British Middle Jurassic stem therians, as the morphological variation within the preserved tooth row encompasses that previously ascribed to three distinct species within two genera: Palaeoxonodon ooliticus, P. freemani, and Kennetheridium leesi. Thus, both P. freemani and Kennetheridium leesi are subjective junior synonyms of P. ooliticus. The dental formula of P. ooliticus (i4:c1:p5:m5) is intermediate between the primitively larger postcanine count (p5:m6-7) of Amphitherium and the reduced number in peramurans and tribosphenidans (p5:m3). Phylogenetic analyses of P. ooliticus generally confirm a close affinity with Amphitherium, but highlight the lack of strong empirical support for hypothesized patterns of divergences among early cladotherians.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 movie rendering</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Movie rendering of Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G. 2015.17.10.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Palaeoxonodon_ooliticus_movie_rendering.mov</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 PLY file</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">3D surface file of Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 in PLY format.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Palaeoxonodon_ooliticus_NMS_G.2015.17.10.ply</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 PLY (dentary only)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">3D surface file of Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 in PLY format (dentary only)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Palaeoxonodon_ooliticus_NMS_G.2015.17.10_dentary.ply</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 PLY (dentition only)</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">3D surface file of Palaeoxonodon ooliticus NMS G.2015.17.10 in PLY format (dentition only)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Palaeoxonodon_ooliticus_NMS_G.2015.17.10_dentition.ply</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Close et al.

Here, by recording from neurons in the forelimb representation of M1 in postnatal day (P) 8-12 rats, we demonstrate a rapid shift in its sensory responses. At P8-10, M1 neurons respond overwhelmingly to feedback from sleep-related twitches of the forelimb, but the same neurons do not respond to wake-related movements. By P12, M1 neurons suddenly respond to wake movements, a transition that results from opening the sensory gate in the external cuneate nucleus. Also at P12, fewer M1 neurons respond to individual twitches, but the full complement of twitch-related feedback observed at P8 is unmasked through local disinhibition. Finally, through P12, M1 sensory responses originate in the deep thalamorecipient layers, not primary somatosensory cortex. These findings demonstrate that M1 initially establishes a sensory framework upon which its later-emerging role in motor control is built.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Matlab Structure of Raw Timeseries data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">eLifeData.mat</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2018-12-27","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/Duj-8MRTDItgqD_XlnZjbZO8wF5FN8ZhwplwtKCH35A",33950,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""James C"",""lastName"":""Dooley"",""affiliation"":""University of Iowa"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/036jqmy94""},{""firstName"":""Mark S"",""lastName"":""Blumberg"",""affiliation"":""University of Iowa"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/036jqmy94""}]","[""myoclonic twitching"",""primary somatosensory cortex"",""Rattus norvegicus"",""EM sleep"",""external cuneate nucleus"",""motor plasticity"",""sensorimotor integration""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41841""}]"

Here we use simulations, focusing specifically on RAD sequences, to highlight some of the unforeseen consequence of excluding missing data from next-generation sequencing. Specifically, we show that in addition to the obvious effects associated with reducing the amount of data used to make historical inferences, the decisions we make about missing data (such as the minimum number of individuals with a sequence for a locus to be included in the study) also impact the types of loci sampled for a study. In particular, as the tolerance for missing data becomes more stringent, the mutational spectrum represented in the sampled loci becomes truncated such that loci with the highest mutation rates are disproportionately excluded. This effect is exacerbated further by factors involved in the preparation of the genomic library (i.e., the use of reduced representation libraries, as well as the coverage) and the taxonomic diversity represented in the library (i.e., the level of divergence among the individuals). We demonstrate that the intuitive appeals about being conservative by removing loci may be misguided.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4

Although there has been recent influx of orthopteran transcriptomic resources, many use pooled ontogenetic stages obscuring information about changes in gene expression during development. Here we developed a de novo transcriptome spanning 7 stages in the life cycle of the acridid grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. Samples from different stages encompassing embryonic development through adults were used for transcriptomic profiling, revealing patterns of differential gene expression that highlight processes in the different life stages. These patterns were validated with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Embryonic development showed a strongly differentiated expression pattern compared to all of the other stages and genes upregulated in this stage were involved in signaling, cellular differentiation, and organ development. Our study is one of the first to examine gene expression during post-embryonic development in a hemimetabolous insect and we found that only the fourth and fifth instars had clusters of genes upregulated during these stages. These genes are involved in various processes ranging from synthesis of biogenic amines to chitin binding. These observations indicate that post-embryonic ontogeny is not a continuous process and that some instars are differentiated. Finally, genes upregulated in the imago were generally involved in aging and immunity. Our study highlights the importance of looking at ontogeny as a whole and indicates promising directions for future research in orthopteran development.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Unfiltered transcriptome</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Raw output from the trinity assembly</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">all6_larval.fasta</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Filtered transcriptome</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Transcriptome filtered (Isopct ≥ 51, FPKM ≥ 0.1, length ≥ 600 bp)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">all6_larva_fpkm0.1_minLen600.fasta</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">DESeq2 Input file</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Count matrix</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">larval_and_erl_adults.counts.matrix</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Sample IDs</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">sample_IDs.xlsx</br></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2017-05-18","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/NGa6-NdxuLnqWYb6Nhd4nB2dxkfDS8RKrSh7CxTYba8",12926,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Emma L."",""lastName"":""Berdan"",""affiliation"":""Museum für Naturkunde"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/052d1a351""},{""firstName"":""Jonas"",""lastName"":""Finck"",""affiliation"":""Humboldt University of Berlin"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/01hcx6992""},{""firstName"":""Paul R."",""lastName"":""Johnston"",""affiliation"":""Freie Universität Berlin"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/046ak2485""},{""firstName"":""Isabelle"",""lastName"":""Waurick"",""affiliation"":""Museum für Naturkunde"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/052d1a351""},{""firstName"":""Camila J."",""lastName"":""Mazzoni"",""affiliation"":""Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05nywn832""},{""firstName"":""Frieder"",""lastName"":""Mayer"",""affiliation"":""Berlin Brandenburg Institute of Advanced Biodiversity Research"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02ewzby52""}]","[""acrididae"",""transcriptome"",""Chorthippus biguttulus"",""transcriptome profiling""]","[{""place"":""Germany""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177367""}]"

A test, linking space-time occurrence models and population demographics","Social learning can be fundamental to cohesive group living, and schooling fishes have proven ideal test subjects for recent work in this field. For many species, both demographic factors, and inter- (and intra-) generational information exchange are considered vital ingredients in how movement decisions are reached. Yet key information is often missing on the spatial outcomes of such decisions, and questions concerning how migratory traditions are influenced by collective memory, density-dependent and density-independent processes remain open. To explore these issues, we focused on Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), a long-lived, dense-schooling species of high commercial importance, noted for its unpredictable shifts in winter distribution, and developed a series of Bayesian space-time occurrence models to investigate wintering dynamics over 23 years, using point-referenced fishery and survey records from Icelandic waters. We included covariates reflecting local-scale environmental factors, temporally-lagged prey biomass and recent fishing activity, and through an index capturing distributional persistence over time, derived two proxies for spatial memory of past wintering sites. The previous winter's occurrence pattern was a strong predictor of the present pattern, its influence increasing with adult population size. Although the mechanistic underpinnings of this result remain uncertain, we suggest that a ‘wisdom of the crowd’ dynamic may be at play, by which navigational accuracy towards traditional wintering sites improves in larger and/or denser, better synchronized schools. Wintering herring also preferred warmer, fresher, moderately stratified waters of lower velocity, close to hotspots of summer zooplankton biomass, our results indicative of heightened environmental sensitivity in younger cohorts. Incorporating spatiotemporal correlation structure and time-varying regression coefficients improved model performance, and validation tests on independent observations one-year ahead illustrate the potential of uniting demographic information and non-stationary models to quantify both the strength of collective memory in animal groups and its relevance for the spatial management of populations.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Spatial similarity index</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This folder contains R code and data to calculate the spatial similarity index (SSI), and to compute and map the ‘distrib(t)’ and ‘counts(t)’ variables, as described in Appendix 2 of the paper.

Training data for gene prediction programs are often chosen randomly from a subset of high-quality genes that ideally represent the variation found within a genome. One aspect of gene variation is GC content, which differs across species and is bimodal in grass genomes. When gene prediction programs are trained on a subset of grass genes with random GC content, they are effectively being trained on two classes of genes at once, and this can be expected to result in poor results when genes are predicted in new genome sequences.

Results: We find that gene prediction programs trained on grass genes with random GC content do not completely predict all grass genes with extreme GC content. We show that gene prediction programs that are trained with grass genes with high or low GC content can make both better and unique gene predictions compared to gene prediction programs that are trained on genes with random GC content. By separately training gene prediction programs with genes from multiple GC ranges and using the programs within the MAKER genome annotation pipeline, we were able to improve the annotation of the Oryza sativa genome compared to using the standard MAKER annotation protocol. Gene structure was improved in over 13% of genes, and 651 novel genes were predicted by the GC-specific MAKER protocol.

Conclusions: We present a new GC-specific MAKER annotation protocol to predict new and improved gene models and assess the biological significance of this method in Oryza sativa. We expect that this protocol will also be beneficial for gene prediction in any organism with bimodal or other unusual gene GC content.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">6hmms_makerStandard_noTEs.gff3</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genome annotation for Six HMMs gene predictions in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">6hmms_makerStandard_noTEs_proteins.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted proteins from the Six HMMs gene predictions in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">6hmms_makerStandard_noTEs_transcripts.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted transcripts from Six HMMs gene predictions in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_high_maker_standard_genes.gff3</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Gene annotations of novel genes predicted by the high GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_high_maker_standard_proteins.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted proteins of novel genes predicted by the high GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_high_maker_standard_transcripts.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted transcripts of novel genes predicted by the high GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_low_maker_standard_genes.gff3</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Gene annotations of novel genes predicted by the low GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_low_maker_standard_proteins.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted proteins of novel genes predicted by the low GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">novel_low_maker_standard_transcripts.fasta</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Predicted transcripts of novel genes predicted by the low GC HMM in rice.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">md5_values</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">The md5 values for the files in this data submission.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2018-11-08","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/TFMVeQEa61uJD_dIHyJkduRSG5bzGOvEzf4h5TJZHaI",7200,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Megan J."",""lastName"":""Bowman"",""affiliation"":""Department of Plant Biology"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/00tdyb139""},{""firstName"":""Jane A."",""lastName"":""Pulman"",""affiliation"":""Department of Plant Biology"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/00tdyb139""},{""firstName"":""Tiffany L."",""lastName"":""Liu"",""affiliation"":""Department of Plant Biology"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/00tdyb139""},{""firstName"":""Kevin L."",""lastName"":""Childs"",""affiliation"":""Department of Plant Biology"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/00tdyb139""}]","[""Oryza sativa"",""gene prediction""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1942-z""}]"

Unusual 3→3 cross-links formed by L,D-transpeptidases were first detected in Escherichia coli more than four decades ago, however no phenotype has previously been associated with their synthesis. Here we show that production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB in combination with elevated synthesis of the (p)ppGpp alarmone by RelA lead to full bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and to broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance. Production of YcbB was therefore sufficient to switch the role of (p)ppGpp from antibiotic tolerance to high-level β-lactam resistance. This observation identifies a new mode of peptidoglycan polymerization in E. coli that relies on an unexpectedly small number of enzyme activities comprising the glycosyltransferase activity of class A PBP1b and the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of DacA in addition to the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">GenomeSequencedataofmutant</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2017-10-24","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/gYPUiYq0yfLSlwosUbaHLZ5LvOW9gbh2Bgep4dNBl1Y",20497,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Christiane"",""lastName"":""Bouchier"",""affiliation"":""Institut Pasteur"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/0495fxg12""},{""firstName"":""Jean-Emmanuel"",""lastName"":""Hugonnet"",""affiliation"":""Sorbonne University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02en5vm52""},{""firstName"":""Michel"",""lastName"":""Arthur"",""affiliation"":""Sorbonne University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02en5vm52""},{""firstName"":""Dominique"",""lastName"":""Mengin-Lecreulx"",""affiliation"":""University of Paris-Sud"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/028rypz17""},{""firstName"":""Yves, V."",""lastName"":""Brun"",""affiliation"":""Indiana University Bloomington"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02k40bc56""},{""firstName"":""Michael"",""lastName"":""van Nieuwenhze"",""affiliation"":""Indiana University Bloomington"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02k40bc56""},{""firstName"":""Louis B"",""lastName"":""Rice"",""affiliation"":""Brown University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/05gq02987""},{""firstName"":""Alejandro"",""lastName"":""Monton"",""affiliation"":""University of Amsterdam"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04dkp9463""},{""firstName"":""Tanneke"",""lastName"":""den Blaauwen"",""affiliation"":""University of Amsterdam"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/04dkp9463""},{""firstName"":""Etienne"",""lastName"":""Carbonnelle"",""affiliation"":""Sorbonne University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02en5vm52""},{""firstName"":""Carole"",""lastName"":""Veckerlé"",""affiliation"":""Sorbonne University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02en5vm52""},{""firstName"":""Kuyek"",""lastName"":""Tu"",""affiliation"":""Sorbonne University"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02en5vm52""}]","[""Escherichia coli""]","[{""place"":""France""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19469""}]"

Whether the specific mutations that evolve in the lab also evolve in nature and whether they have the same impact on evolution in the real world is unknown. We studied a model virus, bacteriophage λ, that repeatedly evolves to exploit a new host receptor under typical laboratory conditions. Here we demonstrate that two residues of λ’s J protein are required for the new function. In natural λ variants, these amino acid sites are highly diverse and evolve at high rates. Insertions and deletions at these locations are associated with phylogenetic patterns indicative of ecological diversification. Our results show that viral evolution in the laboratory mirrors that in nature and that laboratory experiments can be coupled with protein sequence analyses to identify the causes of viral evolution in the real world.

In particular, the pathological diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is still considered as a diagnosis of exclusion of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Periampullary cancers have been previously classified according to the histological type of differentiation (pancreatobiliary, intestinal), but overlapping morphological features hinder their differential diagnosis. We performed an integrative immunohistochemical analysis of pancreato-biliary tumors to improve their diagnosis and prediction of outcome. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study on patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatobiliary system who underwent diagnostic core needle biopsy or surgical resection at a tertiary referral center. 409 tumor samples were analyzed with up to 27 conventional antibodies used in diagnostic pathology. Immunohistochemical scoring system was the percentage of stained tumor cells. Bioinformatic analysis, internal validation, and survival analysis were performed. Results: Hierarchical clustering and differential expression analysis identified three immunohistochemical tumor types (extrahepatic pancreatobiliary, intestinal, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) and the discriminant markers between them. Among patients who underwent surgical resection of their primary tumor with curative intent, the intestinal type showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.19 for overall survival (95% confidence interval 0.05–0.72; p value = 0.014) compared to the extrahepatic pancreatobiliary type. Conclusions: Integrative immunohistochemical classification of adenocarcinomas of the pancreatobiliary system results in a characteristic immunohistochemical profile for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and intestinal type adenocarcinoma, which helps in distinguishing them from metastatic and pancreatobiliary type adenocarcinoma, respectively. A diagnostic immunohistochemical panel and additional extended panels of discriminant markers are proposed as guidance for their pathological diagnosis.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Immunohistochemical typing of adenocarcinomas of the pancreatobiliary system  - data and analysis code</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data and analysis code for study ""Immunohistochemical Typing of Adenocarcinomas of the Pancreatobiliary System Improves Diagnosis and Prognostic Stratification""</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">PCBIL_data_and_code.zip</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Immunohistochemical typing of adenocarcinomas of the pancreatobiliary system - Reproducible computer environment</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproducible computer environment as Docker image for study ""Immunohistochemical Typing of Adenocarcinomas of the Pancreatobiliary System Improves Diagnosis and Prognostic Stratification""</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">pcbil_docker_image.tar.gz</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2016-11-15","2020-06-30","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/nUlfmO6LFxsg9yz5vyg1OPlDd-LD3TbVmP7m-h8CO7E",19810,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Carlos"",""lastName"":""Fernandez Moro"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Alejandro"",""lastName"":""Fernandez-Woodbridge"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Melroy Alistair"",""lastName"":""D'souza"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Qianni"",""lastName"":""Zhang"",""affiliation"":""Queen Mary University of London"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/026zzn846""},{""firstName"":""Benedek"",""lastName"":""Bozoky"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Senthil Vasan"",""lastName"":""Kandaswamy"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Piera"",""lastName"":""Catalano""},{""firstName"":""Rainer"",""lastName"":""Heuche""},{""firstName"":""Sonia"",""lastName"":""Shtembari"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska University Hospital"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/00m8d6786""},{""firstName"":""Marco"",""lastName"":""Del Chiaro"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Olof"",""lastName"":""Danielsson"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""Mikael"",""lastName"":""Björnstedt"",""affiliation"":""Karolinska Institute"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/056d84691""},{""firstName"":""J.

In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence mRNA transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in mRNA-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose Phred score < 2 or < 5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Assembly Files</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">These files correspond to the assemblies described in the manuscript.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">assemblies.zip</br></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2015-01-14","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/avTsYgPvtxoTR4fQdcxxeG8U-q1nbzj19kiRG5ANRdw",1031,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Matthew D."",""lastName"":""MacManes"",""affiliation"":""University of New Hampshire"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/01rmh9n78""}]","[""Trinity"",""genomics"",""RNAseq""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2014.00013""}]"

Previous work in mammalian hibernators suggests that hibernation is activated not by a set of genes unique to hibernators, but by differential expression of genes that are present in all mammals. This question of universal genetic mechanisms requires further investigation and can only be tested through additional investigations of phylogenetically dispersed species. To explore this question, we use RNA-Seq to investigate gene expression dynamics as they relate to the varying physiological states experienced throughout the year in a group of primate hibernators—Madagascar’s dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus). In a novel experimental approach, we use longitudinal sampling of biological tissues as a method for capturing gene expression profiles from the same individuals throughout their annual hibernation cycle. We identify 90 candidate genes that have variable expression patterns when comparing two active states (Active 1 and Active 2) with a torpor state. These include genes that are involved in metabolic pathways, feeding behavior, and circadian rhythms, as might be expected to correlate with seasonal physiological state changes. The identified genes appear to be critical for maintaining the health of an animal that undergoes prolonged periods of metabolic depression concurrent with the hibernation phenotype. By focusing on these differentially expressed genes in dwarf lemurs, we compare gene expression patterns in previously studied mammalian hibernators. Additionally, by employing evolutionary rate analysis, we find that hibernation-related genes do not evolve under positive selection in hibernating species relative to nonhibernators.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Trinity assembly</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Trinity assembly of filtered paired-end reads (phred score >30, both pairs passed QC control) pooling all samples.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Trinity.fasta.tar.gz</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">blastx table for all reconstructed transcripts</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Blastx table against human for all reconstructed transcripts.

We have studied three well-known European ‘replicate’ hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F1 fertility, consistent with the intragenomic ‘coadaptation’ model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole-genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">RADseq vcf file</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">RADseq vcf file individuals described in table S1 in Supporting Information</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">ALL_ALL_dryad.recode.vcf.tar.gz</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">chloro_alba_trem_can_7snp</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Plastid DNA for RADseq for 256 individuals from P. alba, P. tremula and P. x canescens</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2016-02-15","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/q1KFmSjMapzSxZnfagPZBF35f4emtJ6Yjqra6TmuP2U",17839,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""Camille"",""lastName"":""Christie"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""},{""firstName"":""Kai N."",""lastName"":""Stölting"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""},{""firstName"":""Luisa"",""lastName"":""Bresadola"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""},{""firstName"":""Barbara"",""lastName"":""Fussi"",""affiliation"":""Applied Forest Genetics; Bavarian Office for Forest Seeding and Planting; Forstamtsplatz 1 83317 Teisendorf Germany""},{""firstName"":""Berthold"",""lastName"":""Heinze"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""},{""firstName"":""Daniel"",""lastName"":""Wegmann"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""},{""firstName"":""Christian"",""lastName"":""Lexer"",""affiliation"":""University of Vienna"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/03prydq77""},{""firstName"":""Camille"",""lastName"":""Christe"",""affiliation"":""University of Fribourg"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/022fs9h90""}]","[""Quaternary"",""Populus tremula"",""local genetic ancestry"",""Populus x canescens"",""genotyping by sequencing"",""divergence"",""common garden"",""RAD"",""Hybrid zones"",""Populus"",""Populus alba""]","[{""place"":""Hungary""},{""place"":""Austrey""},{""place"":""Italy""}]","[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13587""}]"

Such species may persist in the face of climate warming by migration to track their seasonal climate niche in space and/or by phenological shifts to track favorable conditions in time within the year. To describe the seasonal climate niche of the short-lived annual Mollugo verticillata in California, we used data from herbarium specimens and historic climate records to estimate environmental conditions at the location, month and year of each collection.

2.We used these data in a MaxEnt framework to construct a seasonal species distribution model (SDM) of the species’ climate niche within the total climate space available across all seasons and locations in California. The model provides fine-scale spatial and temporal predictions of habitat suitability, predicting both where and when the species should be observed.

3.We compared the predictions of the model to those from a conventional SDM based on mean annual climate data. Both models showed that M. verticillata is limited to warm environments within California. However, the seasonal SDM also predicted phenology by mapping climate suitability across the state for each month of the year. Mollugo verticillata is limited to warm months, and its seasonal climate niche shifts in space across California in the course of the year.

4.We used the seasonal SDM to map the predicted future species distribution for each month of the year under three warming scenarios. The species is predicted to expand its range and occur earlier in the year in most locations; in the warmest locations seasonal suitability is predicted to decline in the warmest months, which may result in bimodal phenology with a mid-summer gap.

5.Synthesis - We developed a novel species distribution model using herbarium records and monthly weather data, which predicts not only where a short-lived species should be found, but when during the year it is predicted to occur in those areas. This model can be used to predict how climate change will affect the species distribution in space as well as seasonal phenology across the landscape.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">background_by_month_year</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This is the background climate file.

Such traits are important, but they are few compared with complex, polygenic traits influenced by many genes. We know much less about complex traits, and about the changes that occur in the genome and in gene expression during their evolutionary adaptation. Salt stress tolerance is such a trait. It is especially attractive for evolutionary studies, because the physiological response to salt stress is well-characterized on the molecular and transcriptome level. This provides a unique opportunity to compare evolutionary adaptation and physiological adaptation to salt stress. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a good model system to study salt stress tolerance, because it contains several highly conserved pathways that mediate the salt stress response. We evolved three replicate lines of yeast under continuous salt (NaCl) stress for 300 generations. All three lines evolved faster growth rate in high salt conditions than their ancestor. In these lines, we studied gene expression changes through microarray analysis and genetic changes through next generation population sequencing. We found two principal kinds of gene expression changes, changes in basal expression (82 genes) and changes in regulation (62 genes). The genes that change their expression involve several well-known physiological stress-response genes, including CTT1, MSN4 and HLR1. Next generation sequencing revealed only one high-frequency single-nucleotide change, in the gene MOT2, that caused increased fitness when introduced into the ancestral strain. Analysis of DNA content per cell revealed ploidy increases in all the three lines. Our observations suggest that evolutionary adaptation of yeast to salt stress is associated with genome size increase and modest expression changes in several genes.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">454 sequencing data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">454 sequencing data from ancestral(ANC) and evolved yeast populations - base sequences in fasta format along with corresponding base quality scores</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Sequencing_Data_Dhar.tar.gz</br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",1,"submitted","Published","2013-03-22","2020-06-24","public","https://datadryad.org/stash/share/tWSGgL0JqEJ0th-U-pbW4sChmaRQ1IN8vlsc51MVgJ0",4214,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","[{""name"":""stash"",""href"":""https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/stash/blob/main/stash_api/link-relations.md#{rel}"",""templated"":""true""}]","[{""firstName"":""R."",""lastName"":""Dhar"",""affiliation"":""University of Zurich"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02crff812""},{""firstName"":""R."",""lastName"":""Sägesser"",""affiliation"":""University of Zurich"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02crff812""},{""firstName"":""C."",""lastName"":""Weikert"",""affiliation"":""University of Zurich"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02crff812""},{""firstName"":""J."",""lastName"":""Yuan"",""affiliation"":""University of Zurich"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02crff812""},{""firstName"":""A."",""lastName"":""Wagner"",""affiliation"":""University of Zurich"",""affiliationROR"":""https://ror.org/02crff812""}]","[""Experimental evolution"",""Yeast stress adaptation"",""genomics"",""next generation 454 sequencing"",""single-nucleotide polymorphism"",""gene expression"",""ploidy""]",,"[{""relationship"":""article"",""identifierType"":""DOI"",""identifier"":""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02249.x""}]"

Methods for estimating phenotypic selection within a generation based on associations between trait values and fitness (e.g. survival) of individuals are established. These methods attempt to disentangle selection acting directly on a trait from indirect selection caused by correlations with other traits via multivariate statistical approaches (i.e. inference of selection gradients). The estimation of selection on genotypic or genomic variation could also benefit from disentangling direct and indirect selection on genetic loci. However, achieving this goal is difficult with genomic data because the number of potentially correlated genetic loci (p) is very large relative to the number of individuals sampled (n). In other words, the number of model parameters exceeds the number of observations (p ≫ n). We present simulations examining the utility of whole-genome regression approaches (i.e. Bayesian sparse linear mixed models) for quantifying direct selection in cases where p ≫ n. Such models have been used for genome-wide association mapping and are common in artificial breeding. Our results show they hold promise for studies of natural selection in the wild and thus of ecological speciation. But we also demonstrate important limitations to the approach and discuss study designs required for more robust inferences.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Null model simulations</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This R script was used to  simulate random mortality and then infer total selection on genotypes based on allele frequency changes while ignoring the effect of genetic drift.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">nullSim.R</br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Simulated phenotypes based on Timema GBS data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This compressed folder contains the simulated data sets where Timema cristinae GBS data were used as the starting point.

Particularly, large animal models, like nonhuman primates (NHPs), that possess greater physiological, biochemical, and phylogenetic similarity to humans are gaining interest. To assess the translatability of these models into human diseases, imaging biomarkers play a significant role in non-invasive phenotyping, prediction of downstream remodeling, and evaluation of novel experimental therapeutics. This paper sheds insight into NHP cardiac function through the quantification of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers that comprehensively characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of left ventricular (LV) systolic pumping and LV diastolic relaxation. MR tagging and phase contrast (PC) imaging were used to quantify NHP cardiac strain and flow. Temporal inter-relationships between rotational mechanics, myocardial strain and LV chamber flow are presented, and functional biomarkers are evaluated through test-retest repeatability and inter subject variability analyses. The temporal trends observed in strain and flow was similar to published data in humans. Our results indicate a dominant dimension based pumping during early systole, followed by a torsion dominant pumping action during late systole. Early diastole is characterized by close to 65% of untwist, the remainder of which likely contributes to efficient filling during atrial kick. Our data reveal that moderate to good intra-subject repeatability was observed for peak strain, strain-rates, E/circumferential strain-rate (CSR) ratio, E/longitudinal strain-rate (LSR) ratio, and deceleration time. The inter-subject variability was high for strain dyssynchrony, diastolic strain-rates, peak torsion and peak untwist rate. We have successfully characterized cardiac function in NHPs using MR imaging. Peak strain, average systolic strain-rate, diastolic E/CSR and E/LSR ratios, and deceleration time were identified as robust biomarkers that could potentially be applied to future pre-clinical drug studies.","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Non-Human Primate MRI Cardiac Functional Data</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file consists of MRI datasets from eight naive non-human primates.

The mosaic of mimetic wing patterns in Heliconius butterflies makes an excellent system for exploring adaptive variation using next-generation sequencing. In this study, we use a combination of techniques to annotate the genomic interval modulating red color pattern variation, identify a narrow region responsible for adaptive divergence and convergence in Heliconius wing color patterns, and explore the evolutionary history of these adaptive alleles. We use whole genome resequencing from four hybrid zones between divergent color pattern races of Heliconius erato and two hybrid zones of the co-mimic Heliconius melpomene to examine genetic variation across 2.2 Mb of a partial reference sequence. In the intergenic region near optix, the gene previously shown to be responsible for the complex red pattern variation in Heliconius, population genetic analyses identify a shared 65 kb region of divergence that includes several sites perfectly associated with phenotype within each species. This region likely contains multiple cis-regulatory elements that control discrete expression domains of optix. The parallel signatures of genetic differentiation in H. erato and H. melpomene support a shared genetic architecture between the two distantly related co-mimics; however, phylogenetic analysis suggests mimetic patterns in each species evolved independently. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing analyses, we have refined our understanding of the genetic architecture of wing pattern variation in Heliconius and gained important insights into the evolution of novel adaptive phenotypes in natural populations. ","<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry""><h4 class=""o-heading__level3-file-title"">Neighbor-joining trees of H. erato and H. melpomene combined using aligned fragments from the region of highest association</h4><div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Trees output from a neighbor-joining distance analysis run in PAUP*4b10 of the aligned fragments in melperato_alignedfrags_D454to742KB_DATA.nex.

As high throughput sequencing becomes more accessible, more efficient workflows must be developed to deal with the amounts of data produced and better assemble the genomes of de novo lineages. We combine traditional laboratory methods with Illumina NGST to amplify and sequence the largest mammalian multigene family, the Olfactory Receptor gene family, for species with and without a reference genome. We develop novel assembly methods to annotate and filter these data, which can be utilized for any gene family or any species. We find no significant difference between the ratio of genes within their respective gene families of our data compared with available genomic data. Using simulated data we explore the limitations of short-read sequence data and our assembly in recovering this gene family. We highlight the benefits and shortcomings of these methods. Compared with data generated from traditional polymerase chain reaction, cloning and Sanger sequencing methodologies, sequence data generated using our pipeline increases yield and sequencing efficiency without reducing the number of unique genes amplified. A cloning step is not required, therefore shortening data generation time. The novel downstream methodologies and workflows described provide a tool to be utilized by many fields of biology, to access and analyze the vast quantities of data generated. By combining laboratory and in silico methods, we provide a means of extracting genomic information for multigene families without complete genome sequencing.","<div
